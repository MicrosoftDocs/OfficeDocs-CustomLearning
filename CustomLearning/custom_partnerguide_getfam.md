# Partner Onboarding Guide
Get started with learning pathways by following the three steps outlined below. With the three steps, you can build a compelling demo that you can use for engaging presentations with customers.

## 1. Create a Microsoft 365 demonstration environment
You can use demos.microsoft.com to create a demo environment where you can provision the service, validate it, and use it for presenting learning pathways to customers. All partners have access to https://demos.microsoft.com for these purposes. You can use the demos.microsoft.com **Getting Started Guide** if you are new to the demo environment.

## 2. Provision Microsoft 365 learning pathways
You can provision learning pathways with the SharePoint Online Provisioning Service.
- To provision learning pathways, go to the [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-learning-pathways/) solution page. Review the [Learning pathways setup options](./custom_setupoptions.md). 
- Review the [Solution Prerequisites](./custom_provision.md) – as these are common impediments for customer new to SharePoint who may not have all the correct permissions or necessary environment configuration in place, such as a tenant app catalog.
- Try to deploy the solution via a non-Administrator role – to familiarize yourself with the provisioning service error-handling and email service.

## 3. Explore your newly provisioned learning pathways site to get familiar with its capabilities
[Explore your newly provisioned learning pathways site](./custom_exploresite.md) to familiarize yourself with its capabilities. Review the [Admin Success Center](./custom_successcenter.md) for information about content and feature updates, plus planning, customization, adoption, and measuring impact guidance.

## 4. Customize the learning experience
[Customize the learning pathways experience](./custom_overview.md) by working through the following functional areas:
- [Hide and show Subcategories](./custom_hideshowsub.md), [Playlists](./custom_hideshowplaylists.md), and [Technologies](./custom_hideshowtech.md).
- [Copy a playlist](./custom_copyplaylist.md)
- [Create a Custom Playlist](./custom_createnewplaylist.md) – starting with [SharePoint pages](./custom_createnewpage.md), [playlist creation](./custom_createnewplaylist.md), [adding assets](./custom_addassets.md), and [creating subcategories](./custom_createnewcat.md).

## 5. Create a sample learning pathways communication campaign
Create a sample learning pathways communication campaign based on the [downloadable Adoption Kit](https://teamworktools.azurewebsites.net/m365lp/m365lpadoptionkit.zip) and highlight the custom content you created in Step 4. You can leverage this when demoing the complete customer experience.
