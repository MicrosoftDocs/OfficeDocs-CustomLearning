# Use Advisor for Teams with learning pathways to help roll out Microsoft Teams
Now Learning Pathways is integrated with Advisor for Teams. Advisor for Teams walks you through a Microsoft Teams rollout and learning pathways helps complete the last mile of the rollout by offering a customizable learning solution for getting users up-to-speed quickly. Advisor for Teams assesses your organization's Microsoft 365 environment and identifies the most common configurations that you need to update or modify before you can successfully roll out Teams. Then, Advisor for Teams creates a Deployment team (in Teams), with channels for each workload you want to roll out. Each workload in the Deployment team comes with a comprehensive Planner plan that includes all the rollout tasks for each workload, including tasks for creating a learning plan, and driving adoption with learning pathways.
