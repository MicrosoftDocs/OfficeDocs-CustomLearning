# Translate the site name, navigation, and footers
The site name, navigation, and footer of your site needs to be translated manually by a user working in their preferred language profile. For example, if you’ve made changes to the site name, navigation, and footer in English, a user with Spanish as their preferred personal language manually edits and translates the title, navigation, and footer into Spanish. A user with German as their preferred personal language does the same for German. Once the content is translated, it will display for all users of those preferred languages.
