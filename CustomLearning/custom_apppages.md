# Get to know the SharePoint Application pages

Learning pathways provides two SharePoint Application pages that you should know about as an administrator. These two pages are non-editable and should not be deleted. 

- CustomLearningAdmin.aspx
- CustomLearningViewer.aspx

## CustomLearningAdmin.aspx

The CustomLearningAdmin.aspx page provides Administrative features for learning pathways, including hiding and showing content and creating and editing subcategories and playlists. Weâ€™ll cover this page and its functionality in more detail in later sections.

### View CustomLearningAdmin.aspx

1. Click the SharePoint **Settings** icon, and then click **Site Contents** > **Site Pages**. 
2. Click **CustomLearningAdmin.aspx**.

## CustomLearningViewer.aspx
The CustomLearningViewer.aspx page provides a viewer for displaying learning pathways contents in the web part. For example, if you copy a Playlist link and share it with a co-worker, the link, when clicked, takes the user to the Viewer page and displays the linked content. 

### View CustomLearningViewer.aspx

1. Click the SharePoint **Settings** icon, and then click **Site Contents** > **Site Pages**. 
2. Click **CustomLearningViewer.aspx**.
