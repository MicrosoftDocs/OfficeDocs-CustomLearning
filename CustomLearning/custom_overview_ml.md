- English	 
- Chinese (Simplified)
- French
- German
- Italian (Italy)
- Japanese (Japan)
- Portuguese (Brazilian)
- Russian (Russian)
- Spanish
- Dutch

## Get familiar with the SharePoint Online multilingual features
Multilingual support for learning pathways is enabled by SharePoint Online multilingual features for communication sites.
With SharePoint Online multi-lingual support, you can provide translated pages, news posts, and user interface elements in the user's preferred language. Before you start working with learning pathways, take some time to learn how multilingual support works for SharePoint Online communication sites. 
- To learn about SharePoint Online multilingual features, see [Create multilingual communication sites, pages, and news](https://support.office.com/article/2bb7d610-5453-41c6-a0e8-6f40b3ed750c). 

### What you should know before getting started 
Before you get started enabling multilingual support for learning pathways, here's some key information you should know. 

- Page translation features are available on SharePoint Online communication sites only.
- The learning pathways Web part is displayed in the language of the user profile of the person viewing the site.   
- If you provision a new learning pathways site from the SharePoint Provisioning Service, the site is created with English as the default language. The default language cannot be changed. For more information, see [Setup options for multilingual support](./custom_setupoptions_ml.md).
- Previous versions of learning pathways, if installed in your tenant, were provisioned with English as the default language. The default language cannot be changed. For more information, see [Setup options for multilingual support](./custom_setupoptions_ml.md).
- If you provision a new learning pathways site, the site is provisioned in 9 languages. You can turn off the languages you don't want to support. For more information, see [Provision a new learning pathways multilingual site](./custom_provision_ml.md).  
- If you update learning pathways from a previous version to the 4.0 multilingual version, the pages of your site are not automatically translated. Each page created in your default language can have a corresponding page in a chosen target language that you, or someone you assign, manually translates. After a page is translated and published, it will automatically be displayed to users in the language specified in their profile. For more information, see [Update learning pathways for multilingual support](./custom_update_ml.md). 
- The language displayed in the learning pathways web part will depend on their user's personal language and region settings. For more information about setting up a user profile for language and region, see [Create multilingual communication sites, pages, and news](https://support.office.com/article/2bb7d610-5453-41c6-a0e8-6f40b3ed750c). 
- Site navigation, title, and footers must be translated by a person with a user profile in the language to be translated. For more information about translating site navigation, title, and footer, see [Create multilingual communication sites, pages, and news](https://support.office.com/article/2bb7d610-5453-41c6-a0e8-6f40b3ed750c).
