# Create a Custom Playlist

With Microsoft 365 learning pathways, you can create custom playlists from scratch that are tailored to the unique needs of your organization. For example, create a playlist for onboarding new hires to Microsoft Teams. Or create playlists for executive administrators with information suited to their unique role. Or create a First Day for Microsoft 365 playlist that has three simple steps instead of six. You can add a custom playlist to any subcategory. For example, **First Days**, a **Product** subcategory like **Excel**, or even a subcategory that you create. In this section, weâ€™ll cover how to create a playlist, and then cover adding assets to a playlist in the following section, [Add assets to a custom playlist](custom_addassets.md).
