# Manage learning pathways content updates
The Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways catalog is updated on a quarterly basis. The catalog content, which is a set of JSON metadata pointing to learning assets hosted on support.office.com, is stored in a global cache within an organization's tenant. The global cache is automatically updated when a learning pathways Site Collection Administrator or Owner opens the learning pathways Administration page. In addition, the learning pathways global cache is updated every 24 hours. Content updates to the catalog will automatically appear for learning pathways users when the global cache is updated. A learning pathways administrator can hide subcategories or playlists if they don't want to make new content available to users.

As a learning pathways administrator, you use the learning pathways administration page to hide and unhide subcategories and playlists. If you're not familiar with the learning pathways admininstration page, see [Access the Administration page](custom_accessadmin.md).
