# Partner frequently asked questions

### How does Microsoft 365 learning pathways compare to partner offerings from companies that provide enterprise training services?
Several existing Microsoft partners offer training solutions for Office 365 and Windows 10. Many of these partners offer premium services that go beyond the capabilities of Microsoft 365 learning pathways, providing unique and compelling value that further helps customers adopt Microsoft technology. Unique partner capabilities include custom course design, instructor-led design, gamification, user behavior analytics, extensive communication and engagement features, and live support. When considering which training solution(s) to adopt, customers should consider their requirements, timeline, and budget. It is also possible to adopt Microsoft 365 learning pathways in combination with training partner offerings.
 
### Is Microsoft 365 learning pathways an open-source solution?
The Custom Learning site template and content solution is hosted in the open-source SharePoint Patterns and Practices GitHub repository. However, the repository is locked down for only Microsoft submissions at this point. We plan to support partner contributions to both the template and the content store in the future, once we establish an appropriate oversight and compliance plan.  

### Can I supplement the Microsoft 365 learning pathways content feed with my partner-provided content? 
While it’s not possible to supplement the feed directly ‘out of the box’ from the SharePoint Online Provisioning service, there are several integration models that partners can leverage to create aligned value-add services.

1. **Deployment and customization services on behalf of customers** - Partners can perform the solution install, branding, and content customization for their customers. Partners can also provide customized playlists that reference value-add training content they create. 
2. **Customization, rebranding, repackaging, and deployment services on behalf of customers** - Partners can customize site templates and content playlists per customer requirements, and they can repackage and deploy them within customer environments by building on the open-source SharePoint Patterns and Practice framework. 

### How does this solution affect my adoption change management practice? 
Training services are one component of the broader adoption and change management practice space. The Microsoft 365 learning pathways solution serves a specific need to accelerate partners’ and customers’ ability to access and customize Microsoft-provided training content. Microsoft 365 learning pathways does not include custom course design, instructor-led design, gamification, user-behavior analytics, extensive communication and engagement features, or live support. Microsoft relies on Adoption and Change Management partners to fulfill these services for customers. 

### How should I think of the Microsoft 365 learning pathways solution with respect to Microsoft Learn?
Microsoft Learn is a Microsoft-hosted web site that provides guided learning paths with points, levels, and user profiles. It tracks a user’s learning progress on an individual basis. Currently, Microsoft Learn primarily serves Developer and IT audiences. 
Microsoft 365 learning pathways is a customizable SharePoint site solution that offers a live feed of end-user training content from support.office.com. It allows Office 365 customers build and customize a SharePoint-based intranet learning site, hide content for features not supported, build targeted playlists, and configure the Custom learning web part to support targeted learning scenarios.
