# Establish Champions for User Adoption 

Organizational change management is the art of changing the behavior of a targeted group of people. There is a great deal of science and research supporting this practice.

## Who are champions and what makes them tick?

Champions are not only passionate about what they do, but are also excited to share their knowledge and help their co-workers learn more effective solutions. Champions are enthusiastic and often frustrated with existing tools. They will help you win the watercooler buzz challenge!  

We feel it is important to reward champions in meaningful ways. A few suggestions are:

- Allow successful membership in the Champion program to contribute to the employees' performance review
- Acknowledge your most successful Champions with rewards of Office swag and employee perks  
- Engage your Champions with ongoing training and content they can pass along to other employees 

The champion personality does not usually engage because of these rewards, but instead because it creates a more meaningful and measurable experience for them which contributes to employee satisfaction. 

## Why are champions important? 

Learning via co-workers is among the most effective method of learning in a professional environment. Champions will also provide your adoption program valuable insight about what is and is not working about your service deployment, training program and overall sentiment regarding the changes you are implementing.
