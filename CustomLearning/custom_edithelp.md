# Customize the learning pathways site

The Microsoft 365 learning pathways site is based on a SharePoint communication template, so it's easy to modify the site to meet the needs of your organization. You can change the site name, logo, menu items, and the content on the pages. 

> [!TIP]
> Gather feedback from your employees and periodically update the site. For example, you can update the Training events calendar as new events become available. When launching new services, you can unhide content and build targeted training playlists designed for the launch of the new services. 

## Customize the site and web pages

The learning pathways site is fully customizable. If you are not familiar with how to customize your SharePoint site or web pages, we suggest you review the [Customize your SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/customize-your-sharepoint-site-320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b) article on support.office.com.
