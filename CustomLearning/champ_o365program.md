# Office 365 Champions Program 

![make a difference become a champion](media/makeadifference.png)

Microsoft provides a free Office 365 Champions program to support the Champion role worldwide.  This program provides an online community, monthly community calls and content driving adoption across a variety of services in Office 365.

This program is open to everyone.  We recommend that at a minimum anyone running a Champion program in their organization become a member to get access to Champion training materials that can be utilized in their own program. 

Sign up today to become a part of the worldwide community at https://aka.ms/O365Champions
