# Manually installing and configuring Custom Learning for Office 365

The Microsoft Custom Learning Web Part is build using the [SharePoint Framework](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview) version 1.7.1.

To manually install and configure the web part and site collection, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Validate that you have met all the prerequisites.
1. Install the customlearning.sppkg file in your Office 365 Tenant App Catalog.
1. Provision/Identify a modern communication site to act as your Custom Learning for Office 365 home site.
1. Execute a PowerShell script that will configure your tenant with the appropriate artifacts that Custom Learning depends on.
1. Navigate to the CustomLearningAdmin.aspx site page to load the admin web part to initialize the custom content configuration.

## Prerequisites

You must have set up and configured the tenant-wide App Catalog. See [Set up your Office 365 tenant](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant#create-app-catalog-site) and follow the Create app catalog site section. If your tenant-wide App Catalog has already been provisioned, you will need access to an account that has rights to upload a package to it to complete this setup process. Generally this account has the SharePoint administrator role. If an account with that role does not work, go to the SharePoint admin center and find the Site Collection Administrators for the app catalog site collection and either log in as one of the Site Collection Administrators, or add the SharePoint administrator account that failed to the Site Collection Administrators. You will also need access to an account that is a SharePoint Tenant Admin.

## Upload the web part to the Tenant App Catalog

To set up Custom Learning for Office 365, you upload the customlearning.sppkg file to the tenant-wide App Catalog and deploy it. See [Use the App Catalog to make custom business apps available for your SharePoint Online environment](/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) for detailed instructions on how to add an app to the app catalog.

## Provision/Identify Modern Communication Site

Either identify an existing SharePoint communication site or provision a new one in your SharePoint Online tenant. For more information about how to provision a communication site, see [Create a communication site in SharePoint Online](https://support.office.com/article/create-a-communication-site-in-sharepoint-online-7fb44b20-a72f-4d2c-9173-fc8f59ba50eb) and follow the steps to create a communication site.

## Set permissions for the site

You will want to add everyone who should be able to view content to the Visitors group and everyone who should be able to administer custom playlists to the Members group. To configure the site for Custom Learning the first time the user must be either a site collection administrator or part of the Owners group.

Add Custom Learning for Office 365 App to the site collection.

## Execute PowerShell Configuration Script

A PowerShell script `CustomLearningConfiguration.ps1` is included that you will need to execute to create three [tenant properties](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/tenant-properties) that the solution uses. In addition, the script creates two [single part app pages](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/single-part-app-pages) in the site pages library to host the admin and user web parts at a known location.

### Disabling Telemetry Collection

Part of this solution includes anonymized telemetry tracking opt-in, which by default is set to on. If you are performing a manual install and you would like to turn telemetry tracking off, change the `CustomlearningConfiguration.ps1` script to set the $optInTelemetry variable to $false.

If you are not performing a manual install and would like to turn telemetry tracking off, a separate script `TelemetryOptOut.ps1` has been included that when run will disable telemetry tracking.

## Initialize web part custom configuration

After the PowerShell script is successfully run, navigate to `<YOUR-SITE-COLLECTION-URL>/SitePages/CustomLearningAdmin.aspx`. This initializes the CustomConfig list item that sets up custom learning for its first use.

The configuration is now complete and you can move forward with using Custom Learning for Office 365. See the user documentation for more information.
