# Create SharePoint pages for Custom Playlists

One of the unique features of learning pathways is the ability to create playlists that are assembled from assets from Microsoft and from SharePoint assets that you create. In this example, we’ll create a SharePoint page in advance of creating a playlist. The ability to build playlists from SharePoint pages offers a variety of opportunities to build pages using the Web parts available from Microsoft or your organization. For example, a playlist can include a SharePoint page with embedded videos from YouTube, or a form built from Office 365 Forms, or an embedded Power BI report. In this example, we’ll show you how to build a page with the Embed web part and the Text web part.  

## Create a SharePoint page for a custom playlist

2. Click **Add a new section (+)** on the left-hand side of the page, and then click **Two Columns** for the section layout.
