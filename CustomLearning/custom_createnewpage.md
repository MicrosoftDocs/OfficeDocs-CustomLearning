# Create SharePoint pages for custom playlists

One of the unique features of Custom Learning is the ability to create playlists that are assembled from assets from Microsoft and from SharePoint assets that you create. If your organization is migrating from one product to another, for instance, you can create a custom playlist and assets to get users up and running quickly on the newly introduced product. Or you can create a playlist and assets for a particular user group, such as Human Resources, to get them started using a Microsoft Team for collaboration. 

## Imagine the possibilities with SharePoint pages

You can create a custom playlist from existing Microsoft-provided, Custom Learning assets, or from assets created with SharePoint pages. In this example, we’ll create a SharePoint page in advance of creating a playlist. The ability to build playlists from SharePoint pages offers a variety of opportunities to build pages using the Web parts available from Microsoft or your organization. For example, a playlist can include a SharePoint page with embedded videos from YouTube, or a form built from Office 365 Forms, or an embedded Power BI report. In this example, we’ll show you how to build a page with the Embed web part and the Text web part. 

## Create a SharePoint page for a custom playlist

1. Click the SharePoint **Gear** icon, and then click **Add a page**.
2. Click **Add a new section (+)** on the left-hand side of the page, and then click **Two Columns** for the section layout.
3. In the left column, click **+** , and then click the **Embed** web part. 
4. In the right column, click **+**, and then click the **Text** web part. Your page should now look like this.

2. Click the video to play it, then pause it, then right-click on it. 
3. Click **Copy embed code**, then return to the SharePoint page. 
4. Click **Add embed code** in the Embed web part, and then add the code from the YouTube video.
5. Return to the YouTube page and copy the **Description** text for the video.

7. Select the **Edit web part** icon  in the Title area of the SharePoint page, and then name the page “Custom Playlist Introduction”.
