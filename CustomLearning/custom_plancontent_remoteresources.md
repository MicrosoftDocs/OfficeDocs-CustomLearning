# Resources for supporting your remote workforce
In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the April 2020 Content Update provides learning playlists and resources focused on enabling remote work in your organization. We’ve added a new set of Work Remotely playlists, significantly updated the Microsoft Teams content, especially for Teams meetings, and added a new set of Office for the Web playlists. 

## Customize Learning Pathways for remote work
To support remote workers, you can customize the Learning Pathways SharePoint site to direct users to the Work Remotely playlists. For more information about customizing learning pathways.

For more information about how to customize Learning Pathways, see [Customize learning pathways](custom_overview.md). For information about how to add and edit the Web part to filter to a subcategory or playlist, see
