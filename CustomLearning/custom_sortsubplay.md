# Sort subcategories and playlists

Now you can sort subcategories and playlists in learning pathways. For example, if you add a custom playlist to a subcategory, you often want the custom playlist to appear first in the playlist order. The sort order for the web part applies only to the instance of the web part on the page. To get familiar with the sort feature, we recommend that you try it on a test page. 

## Create a new page
1. From the learning pathways site, select **New** > **Page** > **Blank**, **Create page**.
2. Name the page.

## Add the learning pathways web part
- Select **+ Add a new web part**, and then select **Microsoft 365 learning pathways**.
 
## Sort subcategories
You can sort subcategories to put them in the order you want. When you’re done, you can reset the subcategory order to the default if needed.  
1. Select **Edit** to edit the page.
2. Select **Edit web part**.
3. Under **Select a filter**, select **Category**. 
4. Under **Filter to Category**, select a category. In this example, select **Products**. 
5. Toggle **Customize Sort** to **On**, then select **Apply**. 
6. Select the subcategory you want to move and drag it to the new location. 
7. Select **Save as draft** or **Publish** the page. 

## Sort playlists
You can sort playlists to put them in the order you want. When you’re done, you can reset the playlists to the default order if needed.  
1. Select **Edit** to edit the page.

4. Under **Filter to Sub-Category**, select a sub-category. In this example, select **Microsoft Teams**.
5. Toggle **Customize Sort** to **On**, then select **Apply**. 
6. Select the playlist you want to move and drag it to the new location. 
7. Select **Save as draft** or **Publish** the page.
