# Collect feedback from your employees

The adoption of a new collaboration experience is about changing the behavior of your users. Human change requires training, encouragement, and positive examples. It is also critical for people to feel heard during the transition. If you have previously established successful feedback methods in your organization, consider expanding them to include your Office 365 implementation. If you have not done this before, consider one of the following approaches:

## Use Yammer to provide an open community for best practices and support for the experience.
Community-driven feedback methods require champions and service owners to be engaged. Create an open Yammer community that is targetted to the technology you are rolling out.  For instance you may have a general one for Office 365 or choose to target it to users of Office, Microsoft Teams or other technology.  We recommend creating a monitoring schedule for your Yammer community that rotates among these members. 

## Creating an org-wide team within Microsoft Teams (up to 2500)
For smaller organizations an org-wide, public team can also provide a center of gravity for feedback and help.  Consider creating a channel called "Ask a Champion" to foster communication between Champions and employees.  Remember, that currently Microsoft Teams is limited to 2500 people though this will be increasing in the future. You can learn more about org-wide teams in [this article](/microsoftteams/create-an-org-wide-team). 

## Microsoft Forms for Employee Surveys

Use [Microsoft Forms](https://support.office.com/forms) to conduct short surveys about your deployment with key sets of users.  We recommend sending out these surveys at the beginning, in the middle and toward the end of your service deployment.  This will give you valuable data to continue to improve your approach.  

## Highlight the Wins: Share Showcases
As you continue along this journey, you will find showcases of employees whose creativity with Office 365 will surprise and delight you. We recommend that you share these showcases broadly. This will encourage others to be innovative, educate users who may be earlier in the adoption curve, and reward those who’ve taken the time to think through how to best use Office 365 in their environment. Setting a measurable goal of identifying a set number of showcases each quarter is helpful in maintaining your adoption momentum.

Share these showcases in your pubic communities to inspire other employees and help them learn the benefits of Office 365.
