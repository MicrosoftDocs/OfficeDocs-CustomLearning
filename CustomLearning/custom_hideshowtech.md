# Hide and show Technology

In some cases, you’ll want to hide content for a technology that’s not supported in your organization. The Hide Technology feature is designed to prevent technology from appearing throughout the Web part. It offers a broader way to hide and show content than hiding it by subcategory or playlist. For example, you can hide a Viva Engage subcategory, but Viva Engage may still show up in certain scenario playlists such as "Connect your organization with Viva Engage". To ensure content for a specific technology is not exposed to end users, hide it by Technology. 

## Hide a Technology

1. From the Microsoft 365 learning pathways **Home** page, click the **Recommended playlists** tile.
2. From the Custom Learning Web part, select the **Administration** icon.
3. In the dropdown list box in the upper-right section of the **Administration** page, select **Technology**.
For this example, click **Viva Engage** in the left pane of the page, then click the eyeball next to Viva Engage.

- To verify **Viva Engage** technology is hidden, select the browser tab with the **Recommended playlists** page loaded, and then refresh the page. You'll notice that the **Connect your organization with Viva Engage** playlist is hidden.
