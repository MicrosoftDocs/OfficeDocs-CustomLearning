# Where's the Microsoft 365 learning pathways web part? 

When learning pathways is provisioned in your organization, the learning pathways site and web part are added to your organization’s SharePoint tenant. As part of the provisioning, the Microsoft 365 learning web part is added to the following pages of the Microsoft 365 learning pathways site:

- Start-with-Six-Simple-Steps.aspx 
- Recommended-Playlists.aspx
- Get-started with-Office 365.aspx
- Get-started-with-Microsoft-Teams.aspx
- Get-started-with-OneDrive.aspx
- Get-started-with-SharePoint.aspx
- Learning pathways Admin Success Center.aspx

For each page, the Web part is configured differently to show the categories, subcategories, playlists or asset designed to support the intent of the page. The learning pathways web part, as we’ll show you in later sections, can be added to just about any SharePoint page and filtered to show specific categories, subcategories, playlists, or just assets. Let's take a look. 

## View Microsoft Teams playlists

Here’s an example of the **Get Started with Microsoft Teams** page with the Web part filtered to show the learning playlists for Teams. 

- From the learning pathways Home page, select **Get started with Microsoft Teams**.
