Microsoft provides a free Microsoft 365 Champions program to support the Champion role worldwide. This program provides an online community, monthly community calls, and content driving adoption across various services in Microsoft 365.

This program is open to everyone. We recommend that at a minimum anyone running a Champion program in their organization become a member to get access to Champion training materials that can be utilized in their own program.

Sign up today to become a part of the worldwide community at https://aka.ms/M365Champions
