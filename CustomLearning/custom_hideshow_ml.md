# Hide and show learning pathways multilingual content 

To tailor learning pathways for your environment, you can hide subcategories and playlists. To hide content, you use the learning pathways Administration page. The Administration page is always in the default language of English. When you hide and show content, the settings apply to all supported languages. No translation work is required. 

- For more information about hiding and showing content, see Hide and show Subcategories and Hide and show Playlists.
