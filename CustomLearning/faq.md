# Frequently asked questions

## What are the requirements for installing Microsoft 365 learning pathways into my tenant environment?

- SharePoint Online and Communication Sites enabled.
- The individual that will be provisioning Microsoft 365 learning pathways must be the tenant administrator of the target tenant for install.
- A tenant 'App Catalog' must be available within the 'Apps' option of the SharePoint Admin Center.
- If a new App Catalog is created, a wait time of 30 minutes or more is required for the App Catalog to be fully provisioned. Attempting to provision Microsoft 365 learning pathways directly after creating the tenant App Catalog will result in a provisioning error of the learning pathways solution.
- The individual that will be provisioning Microsoft 365 learning pathways must be a site collection administrator of the app catalog in the target tenant for install.

## Why is Microsoft asking for tenant permissions when installing Microsoft 365 learning pathways?

The SharePoint Online Provisioning service uses the permissions to provision the Learning Pathways SharePoint site, create the pages of the site, and to install the Microsoft 365 learning pathways application within their tenant. That's the only reason why we request the permissions. Without the requested permissions the SharePoint Provision Service cannot execute the commands that automatically install the learning pathways site template and web part.

If you still have concerns about this level of access, you can grant the permissions and deploy whichever site templates you are interested in, and then immediately remove the granted permissions to the app in the [Azure app store](https://myapps.microsoft.com).

## How long will it take to install the site in our tenant environment?

It should take less than 15 minutes. This does not include time required to customize the site to your requirements.

## Is Microsoft 365 learning pathways an open-source solution and what are the implications?

Microsoft 365 learning pathways is an open-source software (OSS) solution and as such, carries a set of benefits and considerations germane to OSS:

### Benefits 

- **Microsoft 365 learning pathways is a free solution:** Customers can install the solution in their tenant, customize it and make it available to end users.
- **OSS enables rapid development and collaboration:** All open-source solutions are available to a broad community of contributors. Microsoft is committed to this method of driving innovation. To ensure we are delivering an experience that benefits the widest set of our customers, our core service management team will reserve the right to determine what contributions are merged into our official build.  
- **OSS enables collaboration with partners:** Microsoft is working with several learning partners to support their efforts for future extensions and contributions to Microsoft 365 learning pathways. We will provide more information as these plans become finalized.

### Implications

- **OSS is not a commercially available product:** Commercial products include updating and patching and are included in fee-based support contracts. While Microsoft currently offers documentation, updating and patching for Microsoft 365 learning pathways, it is based on our commitment to improving this particular business scenario. While our plans are to continue investing in learning pathways, be aware that our service management team may change strategies in the future. Any future changes to Microsoft 365 learning pathways will be communicated in advance of taking effect.
- **As OSS, Microsoft 365 learning pathways is supported through an online issues list on GitHub**: Microsoft 365 learning pathways is not covered by any existing Microsoft support contract. Submitted issues are triaged by Microsoft 365 learning pathways service owners and the community. Issue resolution service levels are NOT at the same level as a paid Microsoft support contract.  

### Can we make the Microsoft 365 learning pathways a sub-site of our primary SharePoint site collection?

No. The site is based on a communication site template, which is always meant to be a root site collection.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to consider the permissions your end users will need to access the site. Most organizations have defined security or user groups. You must add the appropriate security groups to your new training portal once you are ready to launch it to your employee community.

### I need to reinstall the site; what should I do?

Follow the installation instructions published [here](custom_provision.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you had disabled telemetry in your prior installation and would like to continue with telemetry disabled, you will need to follow the instructions for disabling the telemetry [here](https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365/blob/a7168c97a76e0b4122e3ddfc530f6a10c724c3e1/installation/README.md).

### We made updates to our implementation of Microsoft 365 learning pathways. Will we lose these updates (made to site template, playlists) if we reinstall the site?

Customizations to individual pages and custom playlists will be lost if you reinstall the site over your current installation.
