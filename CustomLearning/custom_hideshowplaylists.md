# Hide and show Playlists

To tailor Custom Learning for your environment, you may need to hide playlists provided by Microsoft and replace them with playlists that you create for your organization. For example, a common customer use case is to hide the Six Simple Steps playlist from Microsoft and replace it with a playlist that you create for your organization or user group. 

## Hide a playlist

1. From the Custom Learning **Home** page, click the **Office 365 training** tile.
2. From the Custom Learning web part, select the **System** menu, then select **Administer Playlist**. You should now have two tabs open: One with the **Custom Learning Administration** page; and one with the **Office 365 training** page. 
3. From the **Custom Learning Administration** page, under **Category**, select a subcategory, and then select the eyeball for a playlist to hide it. For this example, click the **First Days** subcategory, and then hide the **Six Simple Steps** playlist.

### Verify the playlist is hidden
- To verify the playlist is hidden, select the browser tab with the **Get Started with Office 365** page loaded, and then refresh the page. You should now see the **First Days** subcategory and **Six Simple Steps** is hidden. In this case, there is only one playlist in the subcategory and it's hidden, so Custom Learning also hides the subcategory rather than display an empty subcategory.

## Unhide a playlist

- From the **Custom Learning Administration** page, under **Category**, select a subcategory, select a playlist, and then select the eyeball for the hidden playlist to unhide it. For this example, unhide the **Six Simple Steps** playlist under the **First Days** subcategory.
