# Hide and show the Playlists

To tailor learning pathways for your environment, you can hide playlists provided by Microsoft. 

- You can hide a playlist like Start with Six Simple Steps and replace it with a custom playlist that your create for your organization.
- You can hide a playlist for a product if the playlist covers functionality not supported in your organization. For example, if Microsoft Teams is not configured for calls or meetings, you can hide the **Start chats, calls, and meetings** playlist. 

## Hide a playlist

1. From the learning pathways **Home** page, click the **Office 365 training** tile.
2. From the learning pathways web part, select the **Administer** icon. 
3. From left pane in the **Administration** page, select a subcategory, and then select the eyeball for a playlist to hide it. For this example, click the **Microsoft Teams** subcategory, and then hide the **Start chats, calls, and meetings** playlist.
